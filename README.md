# Calculating-the-Intrinsic-Value-of-Stock-using-Python

An asset's value is determined by its intrinsic value. This metric is determined using an intricate financial model or an objective computation. The intrinsic value of an asset is distinct from its present market value. Investors can determine if an asset is overpriced or undervalued by comparing it to its current price.
Although there are various valuation models that take into account qualitative, quantitative, and perceptual business elements, discounted cash flows are frequently utilised in assessments of intrinsic value.
In order to help us make smarter investing decisions, I utilised the yahoo financials and yahoo fin libraries in this project to estimate the intrinsic worth of a company's shares.
I took into consideration the stocks of the pharmaceutical business DR.REDDY'S LABAROTARIES, which is situated in India, for my project. Hyderabad  is home to the worldwide pharmaceutical business Dr. Reddy's Laboratories. Kallam Anji Reddy, who had previously worked for the mentor company Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Limited, created the business. Dr. Reddy's produces and sells a variety of medications both domestically and abroad. The business produces about 190 drugs, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), diagnostic tools, critical care, and biotechnology products.
